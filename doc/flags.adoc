== Flags

Flags in MoonODE functions and structs are always represented as plain integers,
and encoded in the same way as the corresponding flags in the ODE C API.

The *ode* table contains the XXX values, renamed as *ode.XXX*
(e.g. ode.CONTACTS_UNIMPORTANT, etc.).

For each flags type (see the list below), a utility function is also available to map
an integer code to a list of string literals, each corresponding to an individual bit set 
in the code, and viceversa to encode an integer value from the individual bits given 
as a list of string literals. 
The generic definition of such functions is the following, where *xxxflags* stands for 
*collideflags*, etc:

[[xxxflags]]
* _code_ = *xxxflags*(_s1_, _s2_, _..._) +
_s1_, _s2_, _..._ = *xxxflags*(_code_) +
[small]#Maps the integer _code_ to/from the list of string values _s1_, _s2_, _..._.#

[[collideflags]]
[small]#*collideflags*: Values: '_contacts unimportant_'.#
